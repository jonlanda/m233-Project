# COWORKING-SPACE M233
## Description
### This application was made for a Coworking-Space. You should be able to create a User and then you can login with your User and depending on your role you will get an Admin or User token. The tokens are needed to access the other Endpoints that are protected since a normal visitor shouldn't be able to see that data.
